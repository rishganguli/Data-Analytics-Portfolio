✈️ FAA Wildlife Strikes & Aircraft Damage Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes wildlife strike incidents reported to the FAA and their impact on aircraft safety, operations, and damage costs. The interactive Power BI dashboard highlights trends, geographic hotspots, and seasonal risk patterns, providing actionable insights for aviation safety professionals and policymakers.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to transform raw datasets into meaningful visual insights using data modeling, DAX measures, and storytelling with dashboards.

📊 Key Insights & Findings

🦅 Birds are the most common wildlife involved in strikes, with airplanes being the most frequently affected.

🛫 Take-off runs show high strike frequency, though most result in no damage.

🌎 Pennsylvania and Florida are top hotspots, with strike incidents peaking during summer months.

💸 Most strikes incur little or no cost, but severe incidents remain a safety concern.

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

Power BI Desktop (data modeling, DAX, interactive visualizations)

Power Query for data cleaning & transformation

Custom KPIs: strike frequency, seasonal patterns, cost analysis

Dashboard Design Principles: clear storytelling, drill-down capabilities, and accessibility

🌟 Why This Project Matters

Wildlife strikes pose a significant safety and financial risk in aviation. By analyzing FAA data, this project showcases how data-driven insights can help stakeholders identify risks, allocate resources effectively, and improve aviation safety strategies.

For me, this project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with real-world government datasets

Build professional-grade dashboards in Power BI

Tell a compelling data story with actionable insights
